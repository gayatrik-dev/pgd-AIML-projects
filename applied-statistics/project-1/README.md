4. Accuracy in understanding orders for a speech based bot at a restaurant is important for the Company X which has designed, marketed and launched the product for a contactless delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognition accuracy that measures the percentage of orders that are taken correctly is 86.8%. Suppose that you place an order with the bot and two friends of yours
independently place orders with the same bot. Answer the following questions.
- 4.A. What is the probability that all three orders will be recognised correctly?
- 4.B. What is the probability that none of the three orders will be recognised correctly?
- 4.C. What is the probability that at least two of the three orders will be recognised correctly?
